# Complex-Numbers-Java-
This is a class I wrote in the Spring of 2024 to store and manipulate complex numbers. It includes methods to convert between the Cartesian and Polar forms of a complex number, and methods to add, subtract, multiply, divide complex numbers. Additionally, it has methods to raise complex numbers to a real number power, and methods to take the sine, cosine, natural log, sine inverse, and cosine inverse of a complex number.
